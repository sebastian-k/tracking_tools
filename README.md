# tracking_tools
A place for various tracking tools for Blender

So far there is only the "Setup Plane Track Comp" operator.
Press "J" in the Clip Editor to use it.
It will setup a comp with the active Plane Track and its image for you.
If there alread is a composite node tree, it will only add the image and plane track nodes without connecting it to anything, so you can do the rest.

I plan to add more tools over time, let's see if that actually happens ;)
